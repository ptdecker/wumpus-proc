Written in a straight procedural style.\r\n\r\n## Hunt the Wumpus\r\n\r\nOriginally written by Gregory Yob in the early 1970s while at Dartmouth, Hunt the Wumpus is an iconic early text-base adventure game.\r\n\r\nThis version is adapted from the original BASIC program published in \"More BASIC Computer Games\" from 1979 (although the program itself is much older).  This version adapts the original to Java syntax.  This is a purely procedural implementation not leveraging any object-oriented design principles or language feature.  It is designed to run from the console just as the original would have worked.  As such, it is an illustration of Java syntax but not a particularly good example of a modern object-oriented approach to the problem.  My intent is to simply resurrect the original spirit, then build from that while developing my Java skills.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\n* [Original Article] (http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247)\r\n* [Wikipedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus)\r\n* [BSD wump man page] (http://web.archive.org/web/20090214233010/http://linux.die.net/man/6/wump)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
